## Synopsis

This project is used to generate native Kotlin classes from an xsd schema, similar to the JAXB tool for Java. The project will include a plugin for gradle and Intellij IDEA.

## Code Example

## Motivation

I needed a tool that would generate native Kotlin classes rather than Java classes and then convert to Kotlin.
